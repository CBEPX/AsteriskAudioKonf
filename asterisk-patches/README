asterisk-1.6.2.5-speex16.patch		(Timo Teras)
	This is a patch for adding Speex wideband support to 
	1.6.2.5 of Asterisk.  This patch replaces the LPC10 codec with Speex 
	Wideband. The reason is that LPC10 is not so good quality and it's not
	supported by AsteriskAudioKonf anyway. So this patch will break IAX
	protocol compatibility with LPC10; so if IAX happens to be enabled, do
	not enable LPC10 nor Wideband: they won't work properly. For SIP 
	SpeexWB should work just fine.
